In the lab we used buttons to control LED Matrix. We uUsed it independently as well.
 
The Wiring was done as given in the diagram.
 The bicolor 8X8 LED Matrix was manipulated by means of hex addressing modes. Giving a particular hex code activated a particular led block. 
Hex when written in binary occupied 4 bits. 
Therefore 2 hex digits gave 8 bits, which represented the 8 blocks in a row. 
The blocks to light were given binary 1 while others were given 0 to indicate what led's were to be lighted.
 In the same way we controlled individual led's with the above mentioned devices, to activate the required leds to get the desired display.
