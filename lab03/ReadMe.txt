1. Initially we learnt using of a potientiometer and a js fiddle software to control our led brightness and power
.
2. Next we used two LED's for following purposes - To glow both the LED's
                                                 - To glow one LED's while another one fade away 

                                                 - To control the brightness of both the LED's using a poteniometer 

                                                 - Then we used fiddle to see our code and made some changes in our code.
